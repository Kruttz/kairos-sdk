/**
 * Kairos SDK benchmark — measures generation success rate, retry frequency,
 * token usage, and per-rule failure distribution.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... N8N_API_KEY=... N8N_BASE_URL=... \
 *     npx tsx scripts/benchmark.ts [--count 20] [--output results.json] [--no-library] [--compare baseline.json]
 *
 * Flags:
 *   --no-library   Run without library (NullLibrary) for baseline measurement
 *   --compare      Compare results against a previous run's JSON file
 *
 * All runs are dry-run (no deployment). Telemetry is written to ~/.kairos/telemetry/
