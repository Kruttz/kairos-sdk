**Turn plain English into deployed n8n workflows — validated, corrected, and deployed in one call.**

![Kairos SDK Demo](demo.gif)

Kairos turns plain-English workflow descriptions into validated, deployable n8n workflow JSON. Use it as an **MCP server** (connect to Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or any MCP host — your LLM generates, Kairos validates and deploys, no Anthropic API key needed) or as a **TypeScript SDK** for programmatic control (calls Claude internally with a specialized prompt). Either way, workflows pass through a **23-rule structural validator** with automatic correction, and a local workflow library with **hybrid retrieval** (TF-IDF + node fingerprinting + outcome history + cluster reranking) injects past failure patterns into future generations. With a seeded template library, Kairos achieves **100% first-try structural validation pass rate** across 20 benchmark prompts (meaning the generated JSON is structurally valid on the first attempt — runtime behavior depends on your credentials and node configuration).

```ts
import { Kairos } from '@kairos-sdk/core'

const kairos = new Kairos({
  anthropicApiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY!,
  n8nBaseUrl: 'https://your-instance.app.n8n.cloud',
  n8nApiKey: process.env.N8N_API_KEY!,
})

const result = await kairos.build(
  'Every morning at 9am, send a message to #daily-digest on Slack saying "Good morning team!"'
)

console.log(result.workflowId)      // deployed workflow ID
console.log(result.credentialsNeeded) // what the user still needs to configure
```

### What Kairos does and does not do

| Kairos does | Kairos does not guarantee (yet) |
|---|---|
| Generates valid n8n workflow JSON | Perfect business logic |
| Validates structure before deploy (23 rules) | Correct credentials |
| Syncs node types from your live instance | Runtime success for every API |
| Learns from prior successful builds | That every workflow matches intent perfectly |
| Works through MCP, SDK, or CLI | Full replacement for human review |

---

## Use as MCP Server (no code required)

Connect Kairos to any MCP-compatible host — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any agent that supports the Model Context Protocol. Your host LLM generates the workflow using Kairos's specialized context, then Kairos validates and deploys it. No Anthropic API key needed — no double-LLM calls, no wasted tokens. Kairos auto-syncs your n8n instance's node types so the catalog always matches your exact setup.

### Setup

```bash
npm install -g @kairos-sdk/core
```

### Claude Code

Add to your Claude Code MCP config (`~/.claude/claude_code_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kairos": {
      "command": "kairos-mcp",
      "env": {
        "N8N_BASE_URL": "https://your-instance.app.n8n.cloud",
        "N8N_API_KEY": "your-n8n-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`N8N_BASE_URL` and `N8N_API_KEY` are required for all MCP operations. Kairos syncs your instance's node types to generate accurate workflows that match your exact n8n setup.

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kairos": {
      "command": "kairos-mcp",
      "env": {
        "N8N_BASE_URL": "https://your-instance.app.n8n.cloud",
        "N8N_API_KEY": "your-n8n-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then just ask your agent: *"Build me a workflow that monitors a webhook and sends a Slack notification"* — it will call `kairos_prompt` for context, generate the workflow itself, validate it with `kairos_validate`, and deploy with `kairos_deploy`.

### How the MCP flow works

The MCP server does **not** call an LLM internally. Instead, it gives your host LLM the specialized knowledge and guardrails to generate n8n workflows itself:

1. **Host LLM calls `kairos_prompt`** — gets the n8n system prompt, node catalog, library matches, and failure patterns
2. **Host LLM generates the workflow JSON** using that context (no separate API call)
3. **Host LLM calls `kairos_validate`** — checks the JSON against 23 structural rules
4. If invalid, the host LLM fixes the issues and validates again
5. **Host LLM calls `kairos_deploy`** — sends the validated workflow to n8n

This means Kairos works with **any LLM** — Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, or anything else connected as an MCP host. Zero Anthropic API key needed.

### Available MCP Tools

#### Generation tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `kairos_prompt` | Returns the specialized system prompt, node catalog, library matches, and failure patterns for a given description |
| `kairos_validate` | Validates workflow JSON against 23 structural rules — returns errors and warnings |
| `kairos_search` | Searches the local workflow library for similar past builds |
| `kairos_sync` | Manually refresh the node catalog from your n8n instance (auto-runs on first `kairos_prompt` call) |

#### Deployment tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `kairos_deploy` | Deploys validated workflow JSON to n8n (re-validates before deploying) |
| `kairos_list` | List all deployed workflows |
| `kairos_get` | Get full workflow JSON by ID |
| `kairos_activate` | Activate a workflow |
| `kairos_deactivate` | Deactivate a workflow |
| `kairos_delete` | Delete a workflow |
| `kairos_executions` | List recent executions with status |

## Use as SDK

### Installation

```bash
npm install @kairos-sdk/core @anthropic-ai/sdk
```

`@anthropic-ai/sdk` is a peer dependency — install it alongside Kairos.

---

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- **SDK:** An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com) — the SDK calls Claude internally
- **MCP:** No Anthropic key needed — your host LLM does the generation
- An n8n instance with API access enabled (Cloud or self-hosted) — required for both SDK and MCP (Kairos syncs your instance's node types for accurate generation)

---

## Quick Start

```ts
import { Kairos } from '@kairos-sdk/core'

const kairos = new Kairos({
  anthropicApiKey: 'sk-ant-...',
  n8nBaseUrl: 'https://your-instance.app.n8n.cloud',
  n8nApiKey: 'your-n8n-api-key',
})

// Dry run — generates and validates but does not deploy
const preview = await kairos.build(
  'Receive a webhook, call an external API, and store the result in Google Sheets',
  { dryRun: true }
)

console.log(preview.name)               // workflow name Claude chose
console.log(preview.generationAttempts) // 1–3 (correction loop)
console.log(preview.credentialsNeeded)  // services that need credentials configured

// Live deploy
const deployed = await kairos.build(
  'Receive a webhook, call an external API, and store the result in Google Sheets'
)

console.log(deployed.workflowId) // now live in n8n
```

---

## Benchmark Results

Tested against 20 workflow prompts of varying complexity (simple triggers, multi-step conditional logic, AI agents with memory). Results measure **structural validation pass rate** — whether the generated workflow passes all 23 validator rules, not end-to-end execution correctness.

### Before vs After: Template-Seeded Library

| Metric | Baseline (no library) | With library (105 templates) | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| **First-try pass rate** | 55% (11/20) | **100% (20/20)** | **+45pp** |
| Avg attempts | 1.45 | **1.00** | -0.45 |
| Correction loop usage | 45% | **0%** | -45pp |
| Avg generation time | 30.6s | **20.7s** | -32% |
| Failures | 0 | 0 | — |

The baseline run used Claude with the 23-rule validator and correction loop but no library. The seeded run used the same validator plus a library of 105 workflows (16 organic + 89 ingested from the n8n community). The broader local development library now contains 286+ generated/ingested workflows. Template seeding eliminated the correction loop entirely and cut generation time by a third.

> **Note:** These results confirm that generated workflows are structurally valid and deployable to n8n. They do not verify runtime execution correctness, credential configuration, or whether the workflow output matches user intent.

---

## How It Works

### SDK flow (calls Claude internally)

1. **Search** — Kairos searches its local workflow library for similar past builds. Matching workflows and their failure patterns are pulled into context.
2. **Warn** — Known failure patterns (from library matches and global telemetry rates) are injected into the system prompt so Claude avoids repeating known mistakes.
3. **Generate** — Your description is sent to Claude with a detailed system prompt, forcing a `generate_workflow` tool call that produces structured n8n workflow JSON.
4. **Validate** — The workflow is checked against **23 structural rules** covering node IDs, types, versions, names, positions, connections, forbidden fields, trigger presence, AI connection direction, cycle detection, webhook pairing, and required parameters.
5. **Correct** — If validation fails, the specific rule violations are sent back to Claude for correction (up to 3 attempts, with tighter temperature on the final try).
6. **Strip** — Forbidden server-assigned fields (`id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, etc.) are stripped before deployment.
7. **Deploy** — The validated workflow is posted to your n8n instance via REST API.
8. **Record** — The workflow, its metadata (generation mode, attempt count, failure patterns, credentials needed), and telemetry events are saved locally. Future builds use this history to avoid past mistakes.

### MCP flow (your LLM generates)

1. **Prompt** — Your LLM calls `kairos_prompt`, which searches the library and returns the specialized system prompt, node catalog, library matches, and failure patterns.
2. **Generate** — Your LLM generates the workflow JSON itself using that context. No separate API call.
3. **Validate** — Your LLM calls `kairos_validate`, which checks the JSON against the same 23 structural rules.
4. **Correct** — If validation fails, your LLM fixes the issues and calls `kairos_validate` again.
5. **Deploy** — Your LLM calls `kairos_deploy`, which strips forbidden fields and posts the workflow to n8n.
6. **Record** — The deployed workflow is saved to the local library for future retrieval.

---

## Validator Rules

The 23-rule validator is the core of what makes Kairos reliable. In baseline testing (no library), Claude needed the correction loop 45% of the time. Each rule targets a specific class of error:

| Rule | Severity | What it checks |
|------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | error | Workflow has a non-empty name |
| 2 | error | At least one node exists |
| 3 | error | Every node has a non-empty ID |
| 4 | error | No duplicate node IDs |
| 5 | error | Every node has a type string |
| 6 | error | Every node has a valid typeVersion |
| 7 | error | Every node has a valid [x, y] position |
| 8 | error | Every node has a non-empty name |
| 9 | error | Connections is a plain object |
| 10 | error | Every connection target exists in nodes |
| 11 | warn | Non-trigger nodes have incoming connections |
| 12 | error | No forbidden server-assigned fields |
| 13 | error | Settings is a valid object |
| 14 | error | At least one trigger node present |
| 15 | error | Node type strings match expected format |
| 16 | error | No duplicate node names |
| 17 | error | Credentials have valid id/name shape |
| 18 | error | AI connections originate from sub-nodes, not agent roots |
| 19 | warn | typeVersion is within known safe range |
| 20 | warn | No connection cycles (exempts splitInBatches loops) |
| 21 | warn | Webhook with responseMode="responseNode" has respondToWebhook |
| 22 | warn | Required parameters present for known node types |
| 23 | warn | Node type is recognized in the registry (unknown types may not exist in n8n) |

Errors block deployment. Warnings are recorded and fed back into the prompt for future builds.

### `kairos.build(description, options?)`

Generates and optionally deploys a workflow from a plain-English description.

```ts
const result = await kairos.build(description, {
  dryRun: false,   // set true to skip deployment
  name: 'My Workflow', // override the generated name
})
```

**Returns `BuildResult`:**

```ts
{
  workflowId: string | null  // null on dry run
  name: string
  workflow: N8nWorkflow       // the full generated workflow JSON — inspect before deploying
  generationAttempts: number  // 1–3
  activationRequired: boolean // true if workflow needs manual activation
  credentialsNeeded: Array<{
    service: string
    credentialType: string
    description: string
  }>
  dryRun: boolean
}
```

---

### Workflow management

```ts
// List all workflows
const workflows = await kairos.list()

// Get a specific workflow
const workflow = await kairos.get(workflowId)

// Replace a workflow with a fresh generation from a new description
const updated = await kairos.replace(workflowId, 'new description')

// Activate / deactivate
await kairos.activate(workflowId)
await kairos.deactivate(workflowId)

// Delete (requires explicit confirmation)
await kairos.delete(workflowId, { confirm: true })
```

---

### Executions

```ts
// List recent executions for a workflow
const executions = await kairos.executions(workflowId, { limit: 20 })

// Get a specific execution with full details
const detail = await kairos.execution(executionId)
```

---

### Tags

```ts
const tags = await kairos.listTags()
const newTag = await kairos.createTag('production')
await kairos.tag(workflowId, [newTag.id])
await kairos.untag(workflowId, [newTag.id])
```

---

## Error Handling

All errors extend `KairosError` so you can catch them at different levels of specificity:

```ts
import {
  KairosError,
  GenerationError,
  ValidationError,
  ApiError,
  GuardError,
} from '@kairos-sdk/core'

try {
  await kairos.build('...')
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof ValidationError) {
    // Claude failed to produce a valid workflow after 3 attempts
    for (const issue of err.issues) {
      console.error(`[Rule ${issue.rule}] ${issue.message}`)
    }
    // Attempt metadata and warned rules are also available
    console.log(err.attemptMetadata)  // per-attempt timing, tokens, issues
    console.log(err.warnedRules)      // which pattern rules were warned about
  } else if (err instanceof GenerationError) {
    // Anthropic API call failed (auth, quota, timeout)
    console.error(err.message, err.cause)
  } else if (err instanceof ApiError) {
    // n8n returned a 4xx/5xx
    console.error(`n8n error ${err.statusCode}:`, err.message)
  } else if (err instanceof KairosError) {
    // Any other SDK error
    console.error(err.message)
  }
}
```

| Error class | When it's thrown |
|---|---|
| `GenerationError` | Anthropic API call failed |
| `ResponseParseError` | Claude responded but produced no usable tool call |
| `ValidationError` | Workflow failed 23-rule validation after max retries (carries `.attemptMetadata` and `.warnedRules`) |
| `ProviderError` | Network/auth failure talking to n8n |
| `ApiError` | n8n returned a 4xx or 5xx (carries `.statusCode`) |
| `GuardError` | Input validation failed (empty description) or `delete()` called without `{ confirm: true }` |

---

## CLI

Deploy workflows from the command line — no code required:

```bash
# Generate and deploy
kairos build "Every morning at 9am, send a Slack digest to #daily-updates"

# Dry run only
kairos build "Monitor a webhook and log payloads" --dry-run

# Seed library with n8n community templates
kairos sync-templates --max 200

# View pattern analysis
kairos patterns
kairos patterns --days 60 --json

# Manage workflows
kairos list
kairos get <workflow-id>
kairos activate <workflow-id>
kairos deactivate <workflow-id>
kairos delete <workflow-id> --confirm
```

Set your credentials as environment variables:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export N8N_BASE_URL=https://your-instance.app.n8n.cloud
export N8N_API_KEY=your-n8n-key
```

For dry-run mode, only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is required — no n8n setup needed.

---

## Telemetry

Enable telemetry to log every generation attempt, validation result, and token usage to JSONL:

```ts
const kairos = new Kairos({
  anthropicApiKey: '...',
  n8nBaseUrl: '...',
  n8nApiKey: '...',
  telemetry: true, // writes to ~/.kairos/telemetry/
})
```

Or specify a custom directory:

```ts
telemetry: '/path/to/telemetry/dir'
```

Each event includes timestamp, session ID, token counts, validation issues, and duration — useful for benchmarking and analyzing the correction loop.

### Pattern Learning

When telemetry is enabled, Kairos runs a **pattern analyzer** that learns from every build — successes and failures. The analyzer produces `patterns.json` which is fed back into future generations:

- **Composite scoring** — patterns are scored using `rawConfidence × impact × recency × (1 + stickinessBoost)`, so frequent, recent, sticky failures rank highest
- **Stickiness detection** — rules that persist across consecutive failed retry attempts (the LLM can't self-correct) get a scoring boost
- **State lifecycle** — patterns progress through `draft → confirmed → resolved`, with per-rule resolved thresholds (5 clean builds) and 90-day TTL on resolved patterns
- **Regression detection** — if a resolved rule starts failing again, it's flagged as regressed and prioritized in the prompt
- **Warning effectiveness** — tracks whether warning the LLM about a rule actually prevented the failure, with per-rule pass/fail rates
- **Schema migration** — pattern data auto-migrates across versions (currently v2) so no accumulated knowledge is lost on upgrades
- **Rule co-occurrence** — identifies pairs of rules that commonly fail together (e.g., rules 5+17 always break at the same time)
- **Session depth analysis** — tracks how many attempts each session needed (e.g., 80% are 1-attempt, 15% need 2, 5% need all 3)
- **Warning cap** — max 10 patterns in the LLM prompt, prioritized: regressed > confirmed > drafts
- **Analysis history** — each analysis run appends a summary to `pattern-history.jsonl` for trend tracking over time

Run `kairos patterns` to view the current analysis, or `kairos patterns --json` for raw output.

For CLI usage, set `KAIROS_TELEMETRY=true` in your environment.

---

## Workflow Library & Feedback Loop

Kairos includes a file-based workflow library that stores every generation and feeds failure patterns back into future builds:

```ts
import { Kairos, FileLibrary } from '@kairos-sdk/core'

const kairos = new Kairos({
  anthropicApiKey: '...',
  n8nBaseUrl: '...',
  n8nApiKey: '...',
  library: new FileLibrary(), // stores in ~/.kairos/library/
  telemetry: true,            // enables failure rate tracking
})
```

**What gets stored per workflow:**
- The full workflow JSON and description
- Generation mode (`direct`, `reference`, or `scratch` based on library match quality)
- Number of generation attempts needed
- Failure patterns — which validation rules failed and how many times
- Source workflow IDs (which library entries influenced this build)
- Top match score and credentials needed
- Outcome tracking: retrieval count, usage as direct/reference source, first-try pass rate, avg attempts, and failed rules when used as a source

**How retrieval works:**

Kairos uses a **hybrid retrieval** pipeline with four scoring signals, weighted and combined:

| Signal | Weight | What it captures |
|---|---|---|
| TF-IDF keywords | 0.35 | Text similarity between description and stored workflows |
| Node fingerprint | 0.30 | Jaccard similarity between expected node types (extracted from query) and actual nodes in stored workflows |
| Outcome history | 0.20 | First-try pass rate and avg attempts when this workflow was used as a source — proven templates rank higher |
| Deploy frequency | 0.15 | How often a workflow has been deployed — a proxy for usefulness |

After hybrid scoring, results are **reranked by cluster**: workflows are grouped by node fingerprint pattern (e.g., webhook→slack, scheduleTrigger→httpRequest→gmail), and cluster-level success stats boost or penalize candidates. Clusters with high failure rates on specific rules surface those as warnings.

- High-scoring matches (>= 0.92) provide direct structural templates
- Medium matches (>= 0.72) provide reference examples
- Failure patterns from matched workflows and cluster-level warnings are injected into Claude's prompt

**Template seeding:** Run `kairos sync-templates` to ingest validated workflows from the n8n community library. Templates are safety-filtered (blocks code/executeCommand/ssh nodes, hardcoded secrets) and tagged with `sourceKind: 'n8n-template'`. In benchmarks, seeding the library with 89 templates improved first-try pass rate from 55% to 100%.

The CLI automatically enables the library — no configuration needed.

---

## Custom Logger

```ts
const kairos = new Kairos({
  anthropicApiKey: '...',
  n8nBaseUrl: '...',
  n8nApiKey: '...',
  logger: {
    debug: (msg, meta) => console.debug(msg, meta),
    info: (msg, meta) => console.info(msg, meta),
    warn: (msg, meta) => console.warn(msg, meta),
    error: (msg, meta) => console.error(msg, meta),
  },
})
```

---

## Supported n8n Node Types

Kairos knows about 60+ n8n nodes out of the box, including:

- **Triggers:** Webhook, Schedule, Chat, Manual, Email, GitHub, Telegram
- **Core:** HTTP Request, Set, If, Switch, Merge, Code, Wait
- **Apps:** Slack, Gmail, Google Sheets, Notion, Airtable, GitHub, Telegram
